# Chaotica/Apophysis Plugins Matched to JWildfire

**Note**: These plugins need the [Visual Studio 2017 redistributable](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) installed.  You probably have this already, but if you're on a fresh install and they won't load, try this first.

These plugins attempt to recreate the complete set of JWildfire variations in Apophysis/Chaotica.  They're intended to smooth over JWildfire -> Chaotica workflow, where construction happens in JW and final render occurs in Chaotica.  You should be able to paste a flame directly into Chaotica with these in place.

Please note that some variable names have been altered from original sources in order to match JW naming, where applicable!  This plugin set should be used in its entirety.  It's easiest to just rename your old `plugins` folder and swap back and forth as needed.

Most are converted automatically.  Where automatic conversion fails, and no original source has been injected, an empty shim DLL is compiled.  This is to prevent Chaotica crashes when pasting in data, but also to retain variation names/settings in the save file going forward.

Some JW variations won't come across, probably ever--things using layers, heavy 3D features, etc.
